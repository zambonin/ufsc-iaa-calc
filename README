The IAA (free translation: accumulated performance index) is the "master"
grade of any student at UFSC. It takes in account grades for all the courses
a student has taken, as well as their weekly load. To pass a course, one must
grade 6 out of 10 (weighted arithmetic mean of all the assignments and tests
given throughout that semester).
